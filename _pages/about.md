# About Me
Zhongwei Qiu is currently working as an algorithm expert at Alibaba DAMO Academy, under the leadership of Dr. [Le Lu](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~lelu)).
He is also a postdoctoral researcher at the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, collaborating with Prof. [Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

He received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), supervised by Prof. Dongmei Fu, co-supervised by Dr. [Jianlong Fu](https://jianlong-fu.github.io/) from Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). Before that, he received his B.S. degree in Automation from USTB in 2018. He was a visiting researcher at the University of Sydney (USYD) from July 2022 to July 2023, supervised by Dr. [Chang Xu](http://changxu.xyz/).

His research interest is primarily focused on computer vision, multimodal learning, and artificial intelligence, including Human-Centric Visual Perception and Generation(2D/3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation, Human Motion and Video Generation), Low-level Vision and Generation(Video Super-Resolution, NeRF, Diffusion Model), the applications of AI for Healthcare and Science, and so on.


We have $\color{red}{opening~positions}$ for $\color{red}{research~interns}$ (undergraduate, master, Ph.D., and gap year students are all welcomed). Please drop me an e-mail (qiuzhongwei.qzw@alibaba-inc.com) if you are interested.
